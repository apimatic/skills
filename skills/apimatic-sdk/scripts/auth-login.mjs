/**
 * APIMatic browser-based auth launcher.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node auth-login.mjs
 *
 * Spawns `apimatic auth login` as a detached process so the terminal is not
 * blocked while the user completes the browser OAuth flow. Prints a message
 * for Claude to relay to the user, then exits immediately.
 *
 * After the user confirms sign-in in the browser, Claude should run:
 *   apimatic auth status
 * to verify the session is active.
 *
 * No external dependencies — Node.js built-ins only.
